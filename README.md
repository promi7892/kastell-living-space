# Kastell-State : Aim to offer A place to call Home

Kastell state is a simple website where the user can book for a place to live. in this website a user is able to view a list of properties, book for an appointment to view the place and confrim their booking. In order to book, one need to fill up a form providing some details such as full name , phone number , email and additional needs ( such as gym, pool , garage). To confrum the booking user must need to register or ;og in to the system and After the confrimation user can also see thier booking details in the dashboard. Other than than, the admin is responsilble for handleing other fuctionalities in the dashboard such as viewing all bookings, delete a listing , updating payment status.In the following section I have described how the system can be opareted.
